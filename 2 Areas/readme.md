# Areas

Areas are the second most actionable notes. Unlike projects, none of these have end dates nor a discrete goal that can be meet/failed. These are things such as my daily journal, health information, my physical gardening/planting. I try to keep no more than 14 subfolders/areas at one time in order to keep this folder very focused in scope.
