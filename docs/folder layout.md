# Folder Layout

Your garden will consist of the files/folders inside of the [src](../src/) directory. 


Books
- Each book you read will have a note in here. You could use this to track books you would like to read as well.

People
- I keep notes for all of my contacts, each person will have a note.

Public
- The public folder holds 1 or more static web sites. I use Hugo.

Templates
- Contains files for each obsidian template.
