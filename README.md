# Knowledge Garden Blueprint

This repository serves as a demonstration of how I organize my personal knowledge management system. I refer to it as a knowledge garden, because it is a space where I curate information and nurture it so that it grows and allows me to reap from it. 

## Folder Structure

I use the PARA method laid out Tiago Forte in his book `Building a second brain` to structure the root folders. There are [projects](./1%20Projects/), [areas](./2%20Areas/), [resources](./3%20Resources/) and [archive](./4%20Archive/).
