# Knowledge Garden Blueprint

This repository is an example of how Brandon organizes and manages personal knowledge using a simple and flexible approach. I call this approach a "knowledge garden," because it's a place where ideas are planted, nurtured, and allowed to grow. 

**What's inside?**

The contents of this repository consist of plain text files written in [Markdown format](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/). This choice offers several benefits:

1. **Flexibility:** Plain text files can be easily edited using various text editors, making this approach adaptable to various environments and constraints.
2. **Organization:** A well-structured Markdown document can serve as both the content and the organization for knowledge, making it simple to navigate and find relevant information.

**Editing tools**

I currently uses the [Obsidian app](https://obsidian.md/) to edit my knowledge garden, but the beauty of this approach is its adaptability: the use of plain text markdown files allows the knowledge garden to be edited or queried using a multitude of different text editors or tools.

## How to get started

If you are familiar with git, you can clone this repo to get a local copy of the files. 

If the previous sentence sounds like gibberish to you, then the best way to get the files is to download it from github as a zip file and then extract the files into your documents/home folder.

Now that you have a copy of the files locally, do [whatever the fuck you want](./LICENSE) with the files by adding your own personal knowledge!

## Folder Structure

I have attempted to build structure around my files several different times over the years. I regularly try to reduce the cognitive load needed for me to enter information into and then retrieve information from my knowledge garden. I am currently using the PARA method laid out Tiago Forte in his book `Building a second brain` to structure the root folders. This framework is organized by `actionability`, and has 4 main categories which I have found helpful specifically when I am entering knowledge. There are [projects](./1%20Projects/readme.md), [areas](./2%20Areas/readme.md), [resources](./3%20Resources/readme.md) and [archive](./4%20Archive/readme.md). Each of these categories is further broken down into smaller, more specific subfolders, allowing for even more precise organization. You can find more detailed information on what types of knowledge belong in each location by checking out the respective `readme.md` files within each folder.

## Syncing notes across devices

I enjoy keeping my knowledge files in [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F) because it is a tool that I am very familiar with which makes it easy to keep a history of changes and keep the files synced up across all my devices. That being said, I believe a strength of this approach is how easy you can adapt it to other tools.

Some other options for keeping the files synced up are:
- use the paid Obsidian Sync feature
- Use nextcloud/Onedrive/dropbox or similar cloud storage
- Sneaker net. Copy the files onto a USB drive and plug it into the device you are working on.

## Target Audience Profiles

My primary goal with this repository is to be able to explain the tools and patterns that I follow in a way that is accessible by people who are not me. Below are the different types of people/skill levels that I would like my writing to be coherent for.

### cmd line proficient "hacker"

You are comfortable with developer tools such as git and spend much of your time on your keyboard at the cli. You may write scripts to interact with your garden, and you expect to be able to customize and hack at the process to make it your own.

### student with issued tools

You are a high school student who has a school issued laptop and are using school sponsored software. Portability and minimal overhead are required to meet the needs of your environment. You are probably more technically savvy than the average person, but you have more important things in life than fiddling with note taking and just need something that works.

### Non technical professional

You have some tech skills, but at the end of the day you are primarily focused on using your knowledge garden to help you achieve your goals. You expect structure from the tools and process to help guide you towards what works for you.
